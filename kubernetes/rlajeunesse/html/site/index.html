			<p>ReportIP</p> collects port information for <br class="br-mobile">only security/research purposes.</p>
			<p>It only reads the response data from basic port requests,<br>and never utilizes vulnerability scanning or other exploit scripts.</p>

			<p>Our internet-wide, non-intrusive port scanning does not target specific IP addresses.<br>
				It differs from malicious acts such as DDoS attacks<br>
				in that it simply surveys by knocking on the door(port).</p>
